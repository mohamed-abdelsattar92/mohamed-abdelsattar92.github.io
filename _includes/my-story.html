Hi ðŸ‘‹ <strong>I'm Mohamed Abdel Sattar</strong>, Eversince I was 10 years old I wanted to play on computers and always deal with them. By the age of 15 I was certain that I wanted to be a computer engineer, I didn't know excatly at the time what a computer engineer does except sitting on a computer all day long typing with super speed on the keyboard kind of a Matrix like Neo (Yeah that's what I thought).</br>

Fast forward 10 years I graduated from Faculty of engineering Cairo university, computer engineering major and with my first Job as a software engineer I knew it wasn't all about super speed typing (No shit!!). Data structures, algorithms, OOP, FP, and lots and lots of other concepts and techniques is mandatory if you want to standout as a software engineer, and since then the learning never stopped.</br>

I worked in ERP, Banking, GIS, and Cloud business, shifting between different companies and businesses gave me the flexibility to work with whatever tech stack that is good for getting the job done. It doesn't matter if it's Java, Python, C#, React, or Angular whatever best suits the job at hand is the winning technology.</br>

I worked closely with customers, and worked solely as a backend engineer, front-end engineer, full-stack engineer, and cloud engineer. I've been involved in the whole SDLC from gathering the requirements to production deployment.
Fast fowrad again, currently I'm working as a software development engineer II @Amazon and I'm looking forward to connect with as much as techies as I can, looking forward to connect with you all.</br>
